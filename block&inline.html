        <h2>Paragraph</h2>
        <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.
             Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:
              a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences,
               a paragraph is half a page long, 
               etc. In reality, though, 
               the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</p>

    <h1>Span Element.</h1>
    A paragraph is a foundational unit of writing,<span style="color: red;">
     defined as a group of related sentences that together develop and support a single central idea.</span>
      It serves to organize ideas into manageable chunks, 
      making the text easier to read and understand.
       Paragraphs are the building blocks of larger pieces of writing, 
       such as essays, reports, or articles, 
       and without them, a text can appear disorganized and difficult to follow.
